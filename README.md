# CS300-HashTable-Project
In this project, the primary problem I was solving involved creating an efficient course management system that allowed users to load, search, and sort course data. The goal was to make course information accessible in a way that could handle data efficiently, with optimal retrieval and sorting processes. My approach to the problem involved designing a data structure, specifically a hash table, to store course information in a way that would allow for fast lookups. By leveraging data structures like hash tables, I was able to improve the program’s performance, especially for search and retrieval operations. This experience underscored the importance of understanding data structures and how they play a crucial role in optimizing code efficiency, enabling me to develop solutions that perform well even with large datasets. Throughout the project, I encountered several roadblocks, particularly in understanding how to implement and utilize specific data structures effectively. There were times when choosing the correct data structure was challenging, and debugging the interactions between various components of the code required a deeper understanding of how data was stored and accessed. To overcome these challenges, I spent additional time learning about algorithms and data structure principles. This course significantly contributed to my understanding by reinforcing these concepts and guiding me through practical applications. For instance, learning how algorithms function step-by-step made it easier to comprehend their role in handling data and improving program logic. Working on this project has expanded my approach to software design and program development. I’ve learned the importance of considering the maintainability, readability, and adaptability of my code. As I iterated on this project, I became more aware of structuring code in a way that is easy to understand, update, and extend. I adopted practices such as using clear variable names, breaking down complex functions into smaller, more manageable parts, and documenting my code thoroughly. These practices have helped make my code more readable for both myself and others who may work on it in the future.

Additionally, this project has influenced the way I write code by encouraging me to think about adaptability. By designing flexible functions and avoiding hard-coded values, I’ve aimed to create a program that can be adjusted easily if new requirements arise. The experience of working through this class has given me a foundational understanding of how to read and write code effectively, and learning about algorithms has been instrumental in making the process of understanding complex problems much more manageable. Overall, this project has been an invaluable learning experience, teaching me how to design software that is not only functional but also maintainable, readable, and adaptable.
